# etch-a-sketch

The Odin Project - Etch-a-sketch project

---

About

The Task is to create something between an old-school etch-a-sketch and a sketchpad. The result is going to be a blank canvas sort of, made up of small squares. The exact amount/dimensions can be chosen by the user, so for example the canvas will be made up of 16x16 squares or 80x80. The total size of the canvas will remain the same, the squares will get larger or smaller accordingly.

When user hovers over the squares, it should turn black. This way, the user leaves a trail behind when hovering over the canvas and can essentially draw things.

Bonus: I will try to add an "RGB Mode", where hovered over squares will not turn black but rather a random color from the RGB spectrum. If a square is already assigned a color (when user hovers over it the second/third/so on time), it should turn 10% darker, so when the user hovers over it the 10th time, it should turn black.

Goals

I will try to code this project using CSS Grid instead of FlexBox, as I am now very familiar and confident with FlexBox but have not yet learned or used CSS Grid, which I think would work here very well, so this project should be a good exercise for that.

Also, of course I will try to make the site as asthetically pleasing as I can (I am not a designer).

Review

In the end I decided against using CSS Grid, as I was completely unfamiliar with it and had some trouble trying to fill the canvas using it. While it may have been a good opportunity to use it and learn about it, I think it would have led to a lot of unnecessary frustration and I probably would have taken so much longer to finish the project. I checked TOPs curriculum and saw that Grid will be covered there later on, so I decided to just postpone studying grid until then and maybe revisit this project when I reach that part of the curriculum.

This was a lot of fun to build, while I made a lot of mistakes coding the javascript part I was able to identify them quickly most of the time and not get stuck along the way. I had the basic black and white functionality ready quite quickly, the part I struggled with the most was the optional assignment - not drawing with random colors but the functionality that each square should get 10% darker each time the mouse passes it. This was incredibly fun to figure out how to do and needed quite some creativity (for me at least).

Total time spent on this project: 6hrs 46mins 42sec (tracked using clockify)
