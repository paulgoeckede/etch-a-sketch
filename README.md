# etch-a-sketch

The Odin Project - Etch-a-sketch project

---

About

The Task is to create something between an old-school etch-a-sketch and a sketchpad. The result is going to be a blank canvas sort of, made up of small squares. The exact amount/dimensions can be chosen by the user, so for example the canvas will be made up of 16x16 squares or 80x80. The total size of the canvas will remain the same, the squares will get larger or smaller accordingly.

When user hovers over the squares, it should turn black. This way, the user leaves a trail behind when hovering over the canvas and can essentially draw things.

Bonus: I will try to add an "RGB Mode", where hovered over squares will not turn black but rather a random color from the RGB spectrum. If a square is already assigned a color (when user hovers over it the second/third/so on time), it should turn 10% darker, so when the user hovers over it the 10th time, it should turn black.

Goals

I will try to code this project using CSS Grid instead of FlexBox, as I am now very familiar and confident with FlexBox but have not yet learned or used CSS Grid, which I think would work here very well, so this project should be a good exercise for that.

Also, of course I will try to make the site as asthetically pleasing as I can (I am not a designer).
